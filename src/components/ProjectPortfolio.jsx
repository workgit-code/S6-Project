            good filtering and intuitive navigation is of great importance for
            products like portfolios, so that my projects are effortless to read

            I initially conducted a few rounds of low-fidelity testing, but soon
            transitioned to engaging in brainstorming sessions and iterating

            The testing process primarily involved my team members and teachers,

            extensively involved paper prototypes, which allowed me to explore
            ideas quickly. Subsequently, I swiftly shifted my focus towards
            refining the designs using high-fidelity prototypes.

            A valuable lesson I learned during this process was not to dedicate
            excessive time to envisioning the interface's appearance, but rather
            to start coding as early as possible. Unforeseen imperfections often
            emerge only during the implementation phase, and it is through
            writing the code that they become apparent.

            The portfolio is built using React.js and plain CSS. I intentionally
            avoided using any libraries or packages, instead opting to construct
            the entire code structure from scratch. I specifically chose to work
            with React because it allows me to enhance my coding skills and
            explore new techniques for developing responsive websites and

            to eliminate repetitive styling across multiple files.

            Throughout my studies at Fontys, I have been contemplating this
            question, and not just limited to this semester. However, it was in
            Advanced Media where I had the opportunity to truly reflect on my
            aspirations for the future.
          </p>
          <p className="stage-explanation-text">
            The type of professional I aspire to be is someone who appreciates
            and engages in the aesthetic aspects of design. I thoroughly enjoy
            conceptualizing and envisioning the visual appeal of various
            elements.
          </p>
          <p className="stage-explanation-text">
            Moreover, I find myself drawn to the coding side of implementation.
            I have a genuine interest in understanding how to bring ideas to
            life through technical means.
          </p>
          <p className="stage-explanation-text left-border">
            As for a final response to the question at hand, I must admit that
            it is a journey that I will continue to explore throughout my
            career. However, at this moment, I consider myself a Creative
            Designer. I derive great satisfaction from designing user interfaces
            and experimenting with different technologies, driven by a deep
            curiosity about their functionality and the immense power of media,
            even on a technical level.
