            We had an enjoyable and thrilling week working with a diverse group
            of 10 individuals from various parts of the world. Our project
            focused on <strong>"Empathic building"</strong> and we followed the
            5-step design thinking process throughout. Initially, we identified
            our target audience, considering the wide range of people who visit
            the TQ building: we decided to focus on <strong>students</strong>{" "}
            since we could relate to them the most.

            One major inconvenience we personally encountered in the building
            environment is the high noise level due to the large number of
            people in open areas without walls or partitions. Another common
            issue we all faced, particularly at the beginning of the semester,
            is finding our designated class area or even the right table to sit
            at. This can be challenging since students from various courses are
            situated in the same open space.

            Like any project, we had multiple concepts and ideas to address the

            criteria requires further iteration, testing, and validation, which
            is challenging to accomplish within a week. Nonetheless, jotting
            down all the imagined ideas on a blank space served as a valuable
            exercise to sharpen our problem-solving skills. In the end, we opted
            for the idea that was the most straightforward and personally
            appeared to be useful.

              promptly match you with your class. Upon entering TQ, a screen
              greets you by name and guides you to your class area by indicating
              a designated color-coded path. These dynamic paths, labeled with
              colors, serve as a "smart floor" guiding you to the appropriate
              location within the building.

            Although it was a challenging project, I thoroughly enjoyed each day
            of it as it provided opportunities to learn about people and explore
            the world of design. This experience encouraged me to embrace more

            unique, simple, and impactful that genuinely solves real-life
